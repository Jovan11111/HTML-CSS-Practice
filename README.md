# HTML-CSS-Practice

In this repo, I will be doing all my HTML/CSS practice and learning. I want to recreate famous wesites, like youtube, facebook, or twitter, and also put some simple examples in html/css
I plan on starting a javaScript tutorial which I will also practice in this repo

Site interfaces I've recreated:
